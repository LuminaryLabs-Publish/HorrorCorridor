# HorrorCorridor Current Audit

**Repository:** `LuminaryLabs-Publish/HorrorCorridor`

**Audit timestamp:** `2026-07-09T04-30-54-04-00`

## Summary

`HorrorCorridor` is playable, visually present, network-capable, and already has useful runtime debug frames.

The selection gap in this run was rotation age: every checked non-Cavalry Publish repo was already tracked and had sampled root `.agent` state, so `HorrorCorridor` was selected as the oldest sampled central-ledger fallback.

The implementation gap is unchanged: `interactionRules.ts` and `networkRules.ts` return `GameState` only, `GameCanvas.tsx` still uses object identity and implicit action strings as publish gates, and runtime debug readback has no command-result projection fields.

This pass did not change runtime source. It refreshed root `.agent` state, added timestamped command-result consumer readback docs, and kept the next implementation narrowed to a seeded replay fixture gate.

## Repo selection

The accessible `LuminaryLabs-Publish` repo list was checked during this pass.

## Current interaction loop

```txt
open app
-> start menu
-> choose solo, host, or join
-> create or join room identity
-> complete loading/readiness gates
-> mount GameCanvas runtime
-> initialize renderer, camera, post-processing, maze world, minimap, stores, local pose, networking, cadence, and debug state
-> enter pointer-lock first-person navigation
-> derive interact action from distance-to-end and carried-cube state
-> pickup, drop, place, or remove cube
-> ordered sequence validates anomaly completion
-> ooze cadence advances on host/local authority ticks
-> authoritative snapshot is built and published or skipped
-> renderer, minimap, HUD, completion screen, and runtime debug consume latest snapshot
```

## Current authority loop

```txt
local solo/host interact
-> GameCanvas derives action string
-> applyNetworkInteractionRequest returns GameState only
-> if nextState === currentGameState, GameCanvas returns silently
-> otherwise syncHeldCubesToPlayers
-> publishAuthoritativeState("resync")
-> commitVictory if gameState === "victory"

client TRY_INTERACT
-> host applies applyNetworkInteractionRequest
-> rejected/invalid commands can collapse to unchanged GameState
-> host publishes resync/recovery based on event action, not a result record
-> host needs decision metadata for publish, skip, recovery, and victory

client PLAYER_UPDATE
-> host applies applyNetworkPlayerUpdate
-> missing-player and no-diff paths need explicit result metadata
```

## Target authority loop

```txt
seeded fixture state
-> CommandEnvelope
-> CommandReason catalog
-> interaction/network preflight
-> CommandResult
-> PublishDecision
-> CommandJournal
-> LocalAuthorityCommandConsumer or HostAuthorityCommandConsumer
-> RuntimeDebugCommandProjection
-> publishAuthoritativeState only from explicit decision
-> final replicated snapshot summary
-> DOM-free fixture replay parity
```

## Current risk

The runtime can play, render, sync, and complete, but command authority is still not fixture-safe.

Rejected, skipped, publish-only, unchanged, recovery, and victory commands are not yet first-class result records.

The fixture must start from explicit seed states so accepted, rejected, unchanged, skipped, recovery, and victory rows can be proven without DOM, canvas, PeerJS, Three.js, or browser runtime state.
