# HorrorCorridor Agent Start

**Repository:** `LuminaryLabs-Publish/HorrorCorridor`

**Last aligned:** `2026-07-09T18-30-30-04-00`

## Purpose

This root `.agent/` folder is the operating memory for scheduled and manual breakdown work on `HorrorCorridor`.

Read this folder before changing implementation code.

## Current selection result

The current public `LuminaryLabs-Publish` repository list was compared against sampled repo-local `.agent/START_HERE.md` state and the central `LuminaryLabs-Dev/LuminaryLabs` repo ledger.

No checked public non-Cavalry repo was new, absent from central tracking, missing root `.agent` state, recently added but undocumented, or otherwise undocumented.

`LuminaryLabs-Publish/TheCavalryOfRome` remains excluded by standing rule.

`HorrorCorridor` was selected as the oldest eligible documented fallback among checked public non-Cavalry repos. Its central ledger was at `2026-07-09T16-00-13-04-00`, older than the other checked eligible public entries.

## Current product read

`HorrorCorridor` is a cooperative first-person horror maze under `HorrorCorridor-V1`.

The active runtime is a Next/React client surface that mounts `GameCanvas`, creates a Three.js maze world, uses pointer-lock movement, routes cube interactions through `GameState`-returning rules, publishes authoritative snapshots for solo/host modes, accepts peer messages in host mode, and exposes runtime debug frames/events.

## Current interaction loop

```txt
open app
  -> start menu
  -> choose solo, host, or join
  -> create room, join room, or solo identity
  -> lobby/loading/readiness gates
  -> mount GameCanvas runtime
  -> build renderer, camera, post-processing, maze world, minimap, pose refs, input refs, cadence state, and debug state
  -> pointer-lock first-person navigation
  -> keyboard/mouse input updates local pose and view angles
  -> interact key derives pickup/drop/place/remove from carried-cube state and distance to anomaly
  -> local solo/host applies applyNetworkInteractionRequest directly
  -> unchanged state returns silently on local path
  -> client sends TRY_INTERACT to host
  -> host applies PLAYER_UPDATE or TRY_INTERACT through GameState-returning rules
  -> request-sync/toggle-ready/cancel/default collapse to unchanged state
  -> sync held cubes to players
  -> advance ooze on authoritative cadence
  -> publish authoritative snapshot through implicit reason string
  -> update Three world, minimap, HUD, completion route, and runtime debug frame
```

## Target authority loop

```txt
CommandFixtureSeed
  -> CommandEnvelope
  -> CommandReasonCatalog
  -> InteractionPreflightResult or NetworkCommandPreflightResult
  -> CommandResult
  -> PublishDecision
  -> CommandJournal
  -> LocalAuthorityCommandConsumer or HostAuthorityCommandConsumer
  -> RuntimeDebugCommandProjection
  -> ReplayMatrixRow
  -> GameCanvas consumer splice after proof
```
